# Open Source Licensing for Open MRM

As of March 2022, the Project is using the Apache 2 open source licensing agreement and contributor license agreements (CLA).   As the Project matures, the Community will ask if the members would like to revisit this decision.  It is expected that the Project will use a permissive open source license i.e. MIT, BSD or Apache 2.    The Project would like to encourage the creation of derivative works that can use other licensing.   The Project would like to enable commercial software distributions from the Project’s source code that can be sold with consulting, training and support.    One major question is “are there any software dependencies for the project and what are their software licensing requirements?”   Right now, we believe Apache 2 supports the Community's requirements.
